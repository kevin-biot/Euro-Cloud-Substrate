# ADR-0004: IRN Alignment Is Mechanism-Only

## Status
Accepted

## Context
ECS provides crosswalks that map public or programmatic “what” definitions to ECS “how” mechanics via invariants and evidence (e.g., IRN, IPCEI‑CIS, Gaia‑X, Data Act, SUSE CSF). ECS is not a certification or scoring scheme.

## Decision
- All public‑facing mappings are **non‑normative and mechanism‑only**; they do not define scoring, compliance labels, or certification.
- ECS maps external criteria to existing invariants and evidence expectations; no new invariants are introduced to satisfy a mapping.
- Meta‑criteria outside technical scope (e.g., executive sponsorship, organizational governance) remain out of scope for ECS.

## Consequences
- Prevents ECS from being treated as a certification scheme.
- Keeps mappings grounded in existing invariants and evidence.
- Changes to mappings do not alter ECS semantics; they update crosswalk guidance only.
