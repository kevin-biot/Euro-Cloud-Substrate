# WS3 Spec (Draft)

## Objectives
- Define container and VM execution envelope profiles for ECS.

## Sections to draft
- Kubernetes baseline controls (admission, policy, isolation).
- VM envelope profile, isolation level, and usage criteria.
- Attestation, logging, and evidence requirements.
- Interface points with Policy/Authority and Interop APIs.
- CRP-specific behavior for envelopes under partition (local control-plane, lifecycle, evidence buffering).
