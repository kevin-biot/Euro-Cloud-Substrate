# Governance (Draft)

## Principles
- Architecture-first: coherence over speed.
- Transparency: discussions, notes, and decisions are public.
- Neutrality: no vendor dominance; rotate chairs.

## Roles (to be assigned)
- **Technical Steering Group (TSG):** maintains architectural cohesion; curates roadmap.
- **Workstream Leads:** own specs per `ws*/`; publish drafts; run discussions.
- **Conformance Council (later phase):** defines tests and “ECS Compatible” criteria.

## Decision process
- Propose: open an issue/PR with context and options; link to `decisions/`.
- Discuss: async in issues; synchronous notes published.
- Decide: TSG (or delegated workstream lead) records decision in an ADR under `decisions/`.
- Revisit: decisions can be superseded with a new ADR referencing the prior one.
- Guardrails: see `docs/anti-capture.md` and `docs/non-goals.md` for scope and anti-capture principles.

## Meetings
- Cadence to be defined; published notes required.
- Chairs rotate; agenda and outcomes recorded in-repo.

## Code of conduct
Use respectful, engineering-first discourse. Add a formal CoC if/when needed.
