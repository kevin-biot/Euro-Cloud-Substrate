# PROJECT GUARDRAILS (ANTI-CAPTURE)

- No vendor voting rights before spec freeze.
- No “optional” weakening of core invariants.
- No profiles that bypass CRP or IALP.
- No trademark or branding leverage over the spec.
- Architecture decisions outweigh implementation convenience.
- Decisions recorded via ADRs; transparent issue/meeting notes.
- Rotate chairs/roles to avoid dominance; public participation pathways.
