# PHY Conformance Checklist (Draft)

## Required evidence
- Connectivity dependency graphs (operators, paths, topology).
- Partition scenario declarations and test evidence.

## Minimal tests (pass/fail)
1. **Connectivity declared:** critical services declare network/telecom dependencies.
2. **Single‑path detection:** single‑path/single‑operator dependencies are detectable.
3. **Partition scenario defined:** at least one partition scenario documented.
4. **Evidence of tests:** connectivity assumptions are evidenced via tests/snapshots.
5. **Exportable evidence:** connectivity evidence can be exported.
