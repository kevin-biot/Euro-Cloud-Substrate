# OPS Conformance Checklist (Draft)

## Required evidence
- Runbooks for critical services (normal and degraded modes).
- Role redundancy proof (coverage matrix).
- Evidence of drills/incidents and outcomes.

## Minimal tests (pass/fail)
1. **Runbook availability:** runbooks exist for critical services.
2. **Role redundancy:** no critical operation depends on a single individual.
3. **Access independence:** operator access is not exclusively vendor‑controlled.
4. **Operational drills:** drills or incidents are evidenced at least annually.
5. **Exportable evidence:** operational evidence can be exported.
