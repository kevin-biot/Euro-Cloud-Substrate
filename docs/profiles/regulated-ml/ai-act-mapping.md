# Regulated ML Profile — AI Act Mapping (Draft, Non-Normative)

## Purpose
Map AI Act expectations to ECS “how” (invariants/evidence). This is mechanism-only; no compliance claims.

## Mapping (indicative)
- Art. 10 (Data governance/quality): DATA-01/02 (residency/classification), SUP-01/02/03 (SBOM/provenance), EVID-03 (integrity).
- Art. 11 (Technical documentation): SUP-01/02 (model SBOM, lineage), DATA-04 (lineage traceability).
- Art. 12 (Record-keeping/logging): EVID-01/03/04 (decision-time logging, immutability, export).
- Art. 14 (Human oversight): AUTH-01/04 (authority binding/refusal), POL-04 (fail-closed).
- Art. 15 (Accuracy/robustness): EXEC-01/02 (envelopes, attestation), SUP-04 (integrity), DEP-01/02 (dependency declaration).
- Transparency/traceability: SUP/EVID (model lineage, training provenance, evidence export).

## Notes
- ECS provides mechanism; AI Act obligations remain with the provider/operator.
- No scoring or certification implied.
