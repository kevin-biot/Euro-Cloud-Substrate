# Human & Operations Invariants (OPS) — Draft

## Scope
- Applies to operational capabilities supporting critical services (run, support, recovery).
- Covers human dependency exposure and operational readiness; does not prescribe HR policy or staffing models.

## Invariants
- **OPS-01 — Operational Runbook Availability**  
  Critical services MUST have documented runbooks covering normal and degraded operations.
- **OPS-02 — Role Redundancy**  
  No critical operation MAY depend on a single named role or individual.
- **OPS-03 — Operator Access Independence**  
  Administrative access MUST NOT be exclusively controlled by a vendor.
- **OPS-04 — Operational Capability Evidence**  
  Operational readiness MUST be evidenced (drills, incidents, metrics).

## Evidence expectations
- Runbooks for critical services (normal/degraded modes).
- Role/coverage declarations; evidence of cross-training/rotation.
- Access control design showing non-exclusive vendor control.
- Drill/incident records demonstrating operational capability.

## Non-goals
- No HR policy, staffing mandates, or morale/process frameworks.
- No executive governance or risk acceptance decisions.
