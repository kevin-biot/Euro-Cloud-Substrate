# Data Invariants (DATA) — Draft

## Scope
- Applies to data residency, classification, lineage, and portability.
- Covers cryptographic authority control and enforceable erasure/export.

## Invariants
- **DATA-01 — Data Residency Enforceability**  
  Residency requirements MUST be enforced and evidenced.
- **DATA-02 — Data Class Declaration**  
  Data classification MUST be declared and enforced.
- **DATA-03 — Cryptographic Authority Control**  
  Key control MUST align to declared authority boundaries.
- **DATA-04 — Data Lineage Traceability**  
  Lineage for governed data MUST be traceable and auditable.
- **DATA-05 — Enforceable Erasure and Export**  
  Erasure and export MUST be enforceable and evidenced.

## Evidence expectations
- Residency declarations and enforcement evidence.
- Classification tags and policy bindings.
- Key custody proofs and authority mapping.
- Lineage records and export/erasure evidence.

## Non-goals
- No mandated encryption algorithm or KMS vendor.
- No data governance policy beyond enforceable controls.
