# Invariant Family Deep-Dives

This folder holds per-family notes. The authoritative list and statuses remain in `docs/invariants-v0.3.md`.

## Families (all defined)
- `auth.md` — Authority invariants (local authority satisfiability, refusal, boundary declaration)
- `pol.md` — Policy invariants (versioned artifacts, determinism, enforcement coverage, fail-closed)
- `exec.md` — Execution invariants (envelope declaration, dependency disclosure, auditability)
- `data.md` — Data invariants (residency, classification, lineage, erasure/export)
- `evid.md` — Evidence invariants (first-class output, integrity, completeness, reconciliation)
- `int.md` — Interop invariants (standard interfaces, profile declaration)
- `exit.md` — Exit invariants (exit path, validation, irreversibility compensation)
- `dep.md` — Dependency invariants (critical path, non-substitutable declarations, exclusivity, evidence exposure)
- `sup.md` — Supply-chain invariants (inventory, provenance, N-tier disclosure, opaque fails conformance)
- `phy.md` — Physical/connectivity invariants (declared dependencies, single-path detectability, partition scenarios, evidence)
- `ops.md` — Human/operations invariants (runbooks, role redundancy, access independence, operational evidence)

## Notes
- No new invariants are added here; reference IDs as defined in `docs/invariants-v0.3.md`.
- Use these for scope/evidence/ non-goals per family; conformance shape is in `docs/conformance-model.md`.
