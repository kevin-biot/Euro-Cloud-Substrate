# Invariant Family Deep-Dives

This folder holds per-family notes. The authoritative list and statuses remain in `docs/invariants-v0.3.md`.

## Families (all defined)
- `dep.md` — Dependency invariants (critical path, non-substitutable declarations, exclusivity, evidence exposure)
- `sup.md` — Supply-chain invariants (inventory, provenance, N-tier disclosure, opaque fails conformance)
- `phy.md` — Physical/connectivity invariants (declared dependencies, single-path detectability, partition scenarios, evidence)
- `ops.md` — Human/operations invariants (runbooks, role redundancy, access independence, operational evidence)

## Notes
- No new invariants are added here; reference IDs as defined in `docs/invariants-v0.3.md`.
- Use these for scope/evidence/ non-goals per family; conformance shape is in `docs/conformance-model.md`.
