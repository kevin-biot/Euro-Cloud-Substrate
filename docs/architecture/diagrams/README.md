# Architecture Diagrams (Draft)

## Purpose
Collect and index architecture diagrams for ECS. Diagrams should align to the plane model and Core10 components, and avoid introducing new semantics.

## Files
- `overview.md` — plane model + control/evidence flows
- `crp.md` — crisis resilience partition scenarios
- `ialp.md` — identity/authority/policy decision flow

## Conventions
- Mermaid is the baseline diagram format.
- Keep diagram labels stable and consistent with Core10 terminology.
