# Repository Labels (Suggested)

Create these labels in GitHub to match templates and workflows:
- `spec-draft` — for specification proposals/iterations.
- `discussion` — for open discussions and questions.
- `conformance` — for conformance outline/tests.
- `governance` — for ADRs and process changes.
- `diagram` — for visual assets updates.
- `evidence` — for evidence schemas, export, and audit artifacts.
- `architecture` — for architecture diagrams, archetypes, and control-plane docs.
- `compliance` — for mappings, patterns, and regulatory alignment notes.
- `interop` — for API surfaces and portability work.

If using GitHub CLI and already authenticated, run:
```bash
scripts/create-labels.sh
```
