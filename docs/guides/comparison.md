# ECS vs Existing Stacks (Complementary Positioning)

ECS is governance-first and aims to complement, not replace, provider stacks.

## Themes
- **Connectivity posture:** Hyperscaler edge stacks optimise for hub-spoke connectivity; ECS CRP enables sustained autonomous operation during segmentation events.
- **Authority provenance:** Existing stacks provide RBAC; ECS adds legislative-grade authority-before-execution and refusal semantics (IALP/CRP).
- **Evidence:** Provider logs focus on observability; ECS requires immutable, ordered evidence (IALP) and audit-chain portability.
- **Data governance:** ECS mandates governance metadata (EOSC) that travels with objects across providers.
- **Portability:** ECS defines minimum interop APIs and migration baselines to reduce provider lock-in.

## Reference comparisons (non-exhaustive)
- AWS Outposts / Local Zones
- Azure Stack / Arc
- Google Anthos
- EU providers (e.g., OVH, Scaleway)
