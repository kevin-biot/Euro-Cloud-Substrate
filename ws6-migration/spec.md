- DEP (dependency declarations affecting portability)
- SUP (supply-chain visibility for migrated artifacts)
- EVID (evidence of migration/validation)

## Sections to draft
- Migration scenarios (container, VM, data-only, evidence-only).
- Policy and authority portability.
- Evidence and audit artifact transfer requirements.
- Verification, rollback, and downtime expectations.
