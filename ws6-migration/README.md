# WS6: Migration and Portability

## Scope
Practical migration contract: workload + data + evidence + policy snapshots across providers.

## Deliverables
- `spec.md`
- `invariants.md`
- `conformance-outline.md`
- `diagrams/`

## Open questions
- Minimal portability guarantees and supported migration paths.
- Handling of evidence/audit artifacts during transfer.
- Downtime expectations and validation steps.
