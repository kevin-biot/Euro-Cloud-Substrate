# Euro Cloud Substrate (ECS)

An architectural definition project for a portable, governable, European cloud substrate. This repo hosts the drafts, specs, and workstream materials for defining the minimal shared contracts that European providers can implement.

- Current paper: `VISION.md` (v0.2)
- Roadmap: `ROADMAP.md`
- Workstreams: `ws1-olz-eu/`, `ws2-eosc/`, `ws3-exec-envelopes/`, `ws4-interop-api/`, `ws5-evidence-audit/`, `ws6-migration/`
- Core 10 components: `core10/`
- Governance and contribution: `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CALL_FOR_PARTICIPATION.md`

## Purpose
Define an open, adoptable Euro Cloud Substrate that delivers portability, governability, auditability, and industrialisation by reusing proven primitives and specifying the missing contract layer (identity, policy, execution envelopes, evidence).

## How to get involved
- Read `VISION.md` for the problem framing and objectives.
- Browse workstream folders for scope and deliverables.
- Open issues or PRs against the relevant workstream. Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Add architectural decisions under `decisions/` (ADR format).

## Repository structure
- `VISION.md` — core paper (v0.1 draft)
- `ROADMAP.md` — phases and expected deliverables
- `architecture/` — reference architecture overview and diagrams (future mermaid/plantuml)
- `core10/` — placeholders for the mandatory ECS components
- `ws*/` — workstream folders with scope, invariants, conformance outlines, diagrams
- `decisions/` — architectural decision records

## Status
Draft v0.1. Contributors and workstream leads to be added.
