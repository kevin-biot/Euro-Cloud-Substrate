# WS4 Conformance Outline (Draft)

- Verify required resources/operations exist and meet API contracts.
- Test authz/authn expectations and authority mapping; refusals emit evidence.
- Declare selected evidence profile for audit/event APIs and validate outputs accordingly.
- Validate audit/evidence query interfaces and integrity guarantees (ordering, chain fields).
- Verify export endpoints produce bundles with declared `evidence_profile_id`.
