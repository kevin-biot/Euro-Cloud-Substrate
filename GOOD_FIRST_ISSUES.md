# Good First Issues (Suggestions)

Use the `good-first-issue` label when creating these in GitHub.

1. **Add Mermaid diagram for IALP flow to `architecture/ialp.md`**  
   - Expand the IALP diagram to show inputs → decisions → outputs/refusals with authority/policy snapshots.

2. **Document CRP partition scenarios in `crp/scenarios/`**  
   - Add 2–3 scenario write-ups (e.g., identity outage, network segmentation, stale policy cache) with expected behaviors and evidence.

3. **Create comparison matrix draft for `docs/comparison.md`**  
   - Fill in complementary positioning vs. AWS Outposts, Azure Stack/Arc, Google Anthos, EU providers.

4. **Add NIS2 Article references to `docs/reg-mapping.md`**  
   - Map key articles to ECS primitives (CRP, IALP, EOSC).

5. **Outline evidence schema for `ws5-evidence-audit/`**  
   - Draft core fields and an example event schema to align with IALP and audit chaining.
