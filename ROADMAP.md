# Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Definition (current)
- Publish the v0.1 paper (`VISION.md`).
- Stand up repo structure, workstream stubs, and Core 10 placeholders.
- Recruit initial contributors/workstream leads.
- Begin architectural decision log.

## Phase 1 — Architecture Baseline (8–12 weeks)
- Draft v0.5 for each workstream (spec + invariants + conformance outline + diagrams).
- Publish first reference architecture pack under `architecture/` (Mermaid/PlantUML).
- Define conformance testing approach (without full implementation).

## Phase 2 — Industrialisation (following)
- Implement conformance tests.
- Produce minimal reference implementations.
- Run provider pilots (2–3 vendors) and document migrations.
- Iterate specs based on pilot feedback.

## Deliverables map
- Workstreams: `ws*/spec.md`, `ws*/invariants.md`, `ws*/conformance-outline.md`, `ws*/diagrams/`
- Core 10: `core10/*.md`
- Architecture pack: `architecture/overview.md` + diagrams
- Governance & process: `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `decisions/`
